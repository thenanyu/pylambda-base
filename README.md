# pylambda-base

Default settings for AWS Lambda tooling. Uses https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda

### Install Dependencies
1. Python 2.7 (At the time of writing this, AWS Lambda only supports Python 2.7).
You can use the built-in OSX version of python.
2. Pip (~8.1.1) the best way to do this is usually `sudo easy_install pip`
3. Virtualenv (~15.0.0) once you have pip, you can `sudo pip install virtualenv`
4. Virtualenvwrapper (~4.7.1) `pip install virtualenvwrapper` probably no sudo required, but do so if needed.

### Setup
First go install python-lambda: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lambda/.
Follow the instructions to install python-lambda and set up your AWS Lambda account.
This is all somewhat annoying and you might get stuck.

After you have successfully done that, come back.
